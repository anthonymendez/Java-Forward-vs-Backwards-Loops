# Java-Forward-vs-Backwards-Loops
A quick test to see whether or not a forward or backwards loop is faster. Inspired by this article: https://medium.com/@TravCav/why-reverse-loops-are-faster-a09d65473006

**Disclaimer**

This was not a serious experiment by any means. I was bored and wanted to test out the differents between forward and backward loops in Java.
